\section{Evaluation}

\TODO{Describe the evaluation set up briefly.}



\TODO{- 3 Graph that compares the prcision/recall (F1) and time perofrmance of our multiple approaches. 
}


\TODO{Our appriaches are: 
1. Graphs for 2D CNN with simple linear projection on one of the axis.
2. 2D CNN with improved transformation from 3D to 2D CNN
3. 2D CNN - with - separation and projection and then segmentation with DBSCAN 
4. 3D CNN
5. Different No. of Layers up to 3 and 2 different size of filter. 
 }


- We should run it on a standard machine (better on EC2 because it is better reproducable) and show the processong time performance. 


- We present on our plots, Precision/Recall and Processing time.

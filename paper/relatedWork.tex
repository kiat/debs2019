\section{Related Work}

In this brief section we review some of the most important publications related to LiDAR point cloud classification approaches []

%SAEED: describe some related work:
\textbf{3D shape} analysis Performance of 3D shape analysis is heavily dependent on the input representation. The main representations are volumetric, point cloud and multi-view.

The better compare 3D shape descriptors we will focus on the retrieval performance. Recent approaches show significant improvements on retrieval: Yavartanoo et al. \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1811-01571} introduces multi-view stereographic projection; it first transform a 3D input volume into a 2D planar image using stereographic projection.
Zhou et al. \cite{Zhou_2018_CVPR} proposed a model that operates only on LiDAR data. In regard to that, it is the best ranked model on KITTI \cite{geiger2012we} for 3D and birds-eyeview detections using LiDAR data only. The basic idea is an end-to-end learning that operates on grid cells without using hand crafted features.
Wu et al. \cite{DBLP:conf/icra/WuWYK18} present SqueezeSeg projects point cloud to the front view with cells gridded by LiDAR rotation and then applies normal 2D CNN
for classification and segmentation. 
Riegler et al \cite{DBLP:conf/cvpr/RieglerUG17} design more efficient 3D CNN or neural network architectures that exploit sparsity in point cloud. However,
these CNN based methods still require quantitization of point clouds with certain voxel resolution.

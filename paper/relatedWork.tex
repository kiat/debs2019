In this brief section we review some of the most important publications related to LiDAR point cloud classification approaches []


% KIA: I just put the paper titles here \ldots 
Yavartanoo et al. \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1811-01571} propose an approach for 3D object classification  named SPNet - it is a deep 3D object classification and retrieval using stereographic projection. 

Wu et al. \cite{DBLP:conf/icra/WuWYK18} propose an approach for 3D LiDAR segmentation.

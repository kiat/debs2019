\section{Architecture}


Describe the data processing pipeline here. 


1. Get the raw data and remove the ground (LiDAR data clean up)

2. Segment data and sent it to classifier 

3. Classification with Neural Network. 



Describe \ldots. 

Different forms of data processing architectures that we have implemented and tested . 

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Different methods for removing noise from raw data (data preprocessing). 
  \item Projecting 3D data into 2D data using 3 different projection methods 
  \item CNN  (with and without maxpool) + fully-connected + dropout + fully-connected+softmax
  \item CNN with different number of hidden layers. 

\end{enumerate}

\section{Data Set}

Briefly describe the data set and cite the main grand challange paper. 

We just need to describe what the data is about. 

\begin{figure}%
	\centering
	\subfloat[point cloud readings simulated for a LiDAR sensor]{{\includegraphics[width=7cm]{images/data_overview.pdf} }}%
	\qquad
	\subfloat[a scene with different numbers of objects]{{\includegraphics[width=7cm]{images/GC1.png} }}%
	\caption{The data provided consists of point cloud readings simulated for a LiDAR sensor that mounts 64 lasers(a), and Each reading is composed of attributes where X, Y, and Z coordinates are as presented in (b)}%

We need to mention other data sets like The KITTI Dataset \cite{Geiger2013IJRR}

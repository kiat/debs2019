\section{Data Set}



%SAEED
% The data provided for the challenge consists of point cloud readings simulated for a LiDAR sensor that mounts 64 lasers Fig.\ref{fig:data_overview} a , each shoot 1125 times per rotation. That is, each scene consists of 72,000 readings. Each reading is composed of attributes where X, Y, and Z coordinates are as presented in Fig.\ref{fig:data_overview} b.
% 
% In each scene, objects are representative of urban environments and are of the following types: \textbf{ATM machine}, \textbf{pedestrian}, \textbf{benches}, \textbf{cloth recycling container}, \textbf{drinking fountain}, \textbf{electrical cabinet}, \textbf{emergency phone}, \textbf{fire hydrant}, \textbf{glass recycling container}, \textbf{ice freeze container}, \textbf{mailbox}, \textbf{trash bins}, \textbf{phone booth}, \textbf{trees}, and \textbf{several vehicle types}. In some cases, it is possible for an object in a scene to be hidden from the LiDAR sensor (e.g., when such object is occluded by other objects in the scene)\cite{DEBSGC2019}.

%Briefly describe the data set and cite the main grand challange paper. 

%We just need to describe what the data is about. 



\TODO{We need to mention other data sets like The KITTI Dataset \cite{Geiger2013IJRR}}

	\begin{itemize}
		\item Filter out the LiDAR laser lines that build
		a cylinder 3D shape from the laser standing point $(x=0, y=0, z=0)$.
		\item Figure 1 visualizes the LiDAR data for a single scene with LiDAR laser lines and Figure 2 visualizes the data after
		filtering out the Laser lines.

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Step 2: Object Segmentation and Noise Removal}
	\redb{segment the point cloud to chunks of data}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \blueb{3D to 2D Projection:} projected the 3D data in 4 different ways to a 2D plane and reduced the data dimensionality
		
		\begin{align*}
		d  & = \text{Distance to a projection plane} \\
		x' & =  x (\frac{d}{z}) \ \  , \ \  y' =  y (\frac{d}{z}) \ \  , \ \  z'=  z (\frac{d}{z}) = d
		\end{align*}
		
		
		\item \blueb{Object segmentation using Clustering:} different clustering methods to cluster the data		
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item \textbf{K-means and Mini Batch K-means} on the 3D and project 2D data.
			\item \textbf{Meanshift} on 3D and 2D data
			\item \textbf{DBSCAN} on 3D and 2D
